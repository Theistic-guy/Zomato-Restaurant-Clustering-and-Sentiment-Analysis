# Zomato-Restaurant-Clustering-and-Sentiment-Analysis
<br>
<br>
This project entailed the utilization of advanced data analytics techniques to gain a deeper understanding of the restaurants and customer feedback on the popular online food delivery platform, Zomato.
<br>
<br>
The data procured included information such as the restaurant's name, location, cuisines, average cost for two, ratings, and user reviews.
<br>
<br>
I implemented clustering on the restaurant data through the use of the k-means algorithm. The objective of the clustering was to group similar restaurants together and discern patterns within the data. 
<br>
<br>
I then proceeded to conduct sentiment analysis on the user reviews to gain a comprehensive understanding of the overall sentiment towards the restaurants.
<br>
<br>
In conclusion, this project exemplifies the utility of clustering and sentiment analysis in gaining a more profound comprehension of restaurant data on Zomato.
